This page created to be in one hand of my homeworks, tasks and projects about Time Series Analysis, Data Mining etc.

Below you can see my works classief as their courses.

## IE360 Time Series Analysis

### HW1 Basic Data Visualization

In this work, we  import some datasets from Turkish Central Bank's database and taken from Google Trends. 
And then, visualize it to with simple plot functions to see how it behave and try to do little analysis about the data.

You can find [Task Description](https://github.com/SinaOzturk/Projects/blob/main/IE360_Statistical_Forecasting_and_Time_Series/HW1/IE%20360%20HW1.pdf), [Report](IE360_Statistical_Forecasting_and_Time_Series/HW1/IE360_HW1_Markdown_Report.html) and [Code](https://github.com/SinaOzturk/Projects/blob/main/IE360_Statistical_Forecasting_and_Time_Series/HW1/IE%20360%20HW1%20R%20Script.R) by click into.

### HW2 Simple Forecast for CPI by using Linear Regression

In this work, we import some general data of Turkish economy such as consumer price index and USD/TRY ratio and try to fit a model using such variables for CPI of Footwear and Clothing Category.
We start with simple models, and continue with adding seasonality, different datasets, lags etc. Finally, we had a nice prediction for the test set with our final linear regression model.

### HW3 Forecasting approach to hourly electricty consumption in Turkey by using ARIMA models

In this work, since electricity consumption is very seasonal data, first we start to understand in which time intervals we have seasonality with decompose the data. After understand the seasonality characteristic of the data, we start to fit a model with AR, MA, ARIMA and paramater tuning. After finding the best model, we forecast for the next 2 weeks. At the end, we calculate errors and discussed what can be done for the next steps.
